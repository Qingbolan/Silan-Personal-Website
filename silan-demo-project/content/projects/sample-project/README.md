# Sample Project

This is a sample project file to demonstrate the project structure and capabilities of Silan Database Tools.

## Overview

This project showcases how to structure and manage project documentation using Silan. It includes all the essential elements you'll need for documenting your own projects.

## Features

- âœ… **Structured Documentation**: Organized with clear sections
- âœ… **Frontmatter Configuration**: Rich metadata support
- âœ… **Database Integration**: Automatic sync to your database
- âœ… **Template System**: Consistent project structure
- âœ… **Technology Tracking**: Keep track of tools and frameworks
- âœ… **Status Management**: Track project progress

## Project Structure

```
sample-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/             # Additional documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ src/              # Source code (if applicable)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/            # Test files
