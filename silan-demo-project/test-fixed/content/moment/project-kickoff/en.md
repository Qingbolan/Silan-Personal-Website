# ðŸš€ Project Kickoff - Portfolio Management System

## What Happened

Today we officially kicked off the new Portfolio Management System project! The team gathered for our initial planning session and I'm excited about the direction we're heading.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Tech Stack**: Decided on React + TypeScript for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for main data, Redis for caching
- **Timeline**: 12-week development cycle with 2-week sprints
- **Team Structure**: 3 developers, 1 designer, 1 product manager

## Challenges Identified

- Integration with existing authentication system
- Data migration from legacy portfolio tools
- Performance requirements for large portfolios
- Mobile responsiveness needs

## Next Steps

- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Create project repository structure
- [ ] Design database schema
- [ ] Build initial wireframes
- [ ] Schedule sprint planning session

## Team Energy

Everyone is pumped! The designer already has some great ideas for the user interface, and the backend team is excited about implementing the new architecture patterns we've been wanting to try.

## Personal Reflection

This project feels different - there's a real sense of ownership and enthusiasm from everyone involved. Looking forward to seeing what we build together.
